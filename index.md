### About | [Open Source Clojure](/clojure-oss.html)

Experienced software artisan living in Bengaluru, India. I love what I do. I have worked in various domains and
software technologies. In the recent years I have been interested in distributed systems, databases, scalability
and performance. Effectiveness of ideas depends on the context, so I tend to judiciously combine good ideas
irrespective of which paradigms they identify with.

I have created many Open Source projects using Clojure and Java. I help organize the
[Bangalore-Clojure meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Bangalore-Clojure-User-Group/).
